# Anaemia Prediction 💉

This project aims to predict anaemia using machine learning techniques based on key health indicators. It helps in early identification of individuals at risk, assisting in timely medical intervention.

## 🔍 Overview

Anaemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. This project utilizes a dataset containing various medical attributes and applies machine learning models to predict whether a person is anaemic.

## 🧠 Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection
* Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
* Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
* Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Output

* Accuracy of trained models
* Confusion matrix and classification report
* Best model selected based on performance metrics

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anaemia-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and open the notebook or script.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook/script to train and test models.

## 🏁 Future Improvements

* Integration with a web interface
* Real-time prediction using user input
* Deployment using Flask or Streamlit
